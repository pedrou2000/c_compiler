# TITLE OF THE PROJECT 

## 1. Description of the Project

[//]: # "What was the purpose of the project?" 
The purpose of this project is to create a compiler for a programming language called `alfa` which is a slight simplification of the `C` programming language. Newer versions of the compiler will aim to compile real `C` files. The compiler takes programs written in `alfa` and transform them into `assembly language` programs.
